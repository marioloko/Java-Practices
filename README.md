Codes in this section are done with Java7.0.
This repository is for practices of the Universidad Carlos III in Legan√©s.
All the practices will have a description of what they should do, and then
I will post the code to show what I do, all the practices are evaluated and are
well done but I think that they can improve more and more, so if you has any
suggestion tell me whatever you though.
Thanks!!
